# Features
All files for x-server, dwm and ST, that are needed to get a minimal arch install running with ease! 

I will add more Customisation soon

Featuring my hot minimal ST and DWM theme :D

Obviously the worlds best config for productivity! (100% confirmed)

# Setup
- install MINIMAL arch
- chmod +x the setup.sh file i provided
- run setup.sh
- run "sudo make clean install" in both the dwm and st directory
- copy the .xinitrc file into your home directory (make sure you rename the kind of config you want to ".xinitrc")
- type startx to start dwm
